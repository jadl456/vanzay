      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This is the Privacy Policy of Hyperconnect, Inc. and Vanzay and its various &amp; next versions including Vanzay web
        version (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Vanzay", "us", "we", or "our") and is incorporated into and is
        subject to our Terms of Use. In this Privacy
        Policy, we refer to our products and services as the "Service". Please read on to learn more about our data
        handling practices. Your use of the Service signifies that you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. If
        you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Information we collect</h2>

      <p>
        When you install the Service on your device and register with Vanzay, personally identifiable information about
        you may be collected during the download process for the Service (as requested during the download process) and
        when you register with us. For registration through Vanzay, you are required to provide your mobile phone number
        or your email address, city location, gender, name, depending on the device(s) you are using on the Service. You
        may also provide personally identifiable information, but that is optional. When you log in using your Facebook
        account, we may collect additional information you make available to us (see "Your User Profile" below).
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, when you install the Service on your device and register with Vanzay, you may will be asked to allow
        us access to your address book. If you consent, we will have access to contact information in your address book
        on the device you use for the Service (names, numbers, emails, and Facebook IDs, but not notes or other personal
        information in your address book) and we will store them on our servers and use them to help you use the
        Service, for example, by synchronizing your Vanzay contacts between different devices you may want to use with the
        Service. If you do not want Vanzay to store this information, you may opt-out through your account settings in the
        Vanzay application at any time. However, we may not be able to offer some of the features that require this
        information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vanzay may also collect and gather non-personally identifiable information, such as certain profile information
        including country of residence and preferences. In addition, Vanzay may collect and store information about your
        and others’ usage of and interaction with the Service and our websites, including matches, numbers of matches
        made by members, match durations, text messages, usage by geographies, device and connection information, IP
        address, device capability, bandwidth, statistics on page views, network type and traffic to and from our
        websites.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you give us permission, we can collect your geolocation data via GPS. If you decline permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vanzay allows you to share text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and other communications in the Vanzay
        application with other users, and if you choose to do so your text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and
        other communications will be stored on our servers. In addition, if you choose to share these items with other
        Vanzay users, we may not be able to remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have
        shared them with. Sending and sharing text messages, photos, screenshots, videos or other communications in the
        Vanzay application is your decision. By choosing to share that information, you should understand that you may no
        longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending in
        part on your actions or the actions of others with whom you have shared the information). Vanzay is not
        responsible for any use or misuse of information you share. . In addition, in case your conversation partner
        reports your abusive behavior or language to us, then the conversation information such as voices, screenshots
        or contents of conversation which has been stored only in your partner's device may be transferred to our
        servers. Such transferred information will be processed by us to ascertain the genuineness of the report and
        determine your penalty levels, if needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vanzay may also collect and gather user contents (e.g., photos, screenshots, comments, and other materials) that
        you create on the Service. Your photo can be taken by other users on the Vanzay, and If they use capturing
        function provided by the Vanzay, those photos can be stored and used for Vanzay and 3rd party’s service (e.g.
        Facebook, etc.). You can change sharing option of 3rd party on the Vanzay settings. If you do not agree with all
        the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <p>
        To complete a commerce transaction on Vanzay item shop, you will be requested to provide your payment information,
        including your credit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. In that event, we will
        transmit your information securely directly to a third party vendor or merchant who will collect such
        information in order to process and fulfill your purchase. Vanzay does not process or store your payment
        information. However, we may store other information about your purchases made on the Service, which may include
        the merchant’s name, the date, time and amount of the transaction and other behavioral information.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also collect error-reporting information if the Service crashes or hangs up so that we can investigate the
        error and improve the stability of the Service for future releases. In general these reports do not contain
        personally identifiable information, or only incidentally. As part of these error reports, we receive
        information about the type and version of your device, the device identifier, the time the error occurred, the
        feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred. We do not use this information for
        any purpose other than investigating and fixing the error.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt30 fn">Your User Profile</h2>

      <p>
        The information you enter into your user profile (your “Profile”) may be shared with your Vanzay contacts. You
        control your Profile and you can access and modify your Profile from the Vanzay application at any time. In
        addition, if you register with Vanzay using your Facebook account (e.g. Facebook Connect), we may store your
        Facebook ID and corresponding token on our servers and, if you give us your express consent, we will have access
        to and may collect certain information that you make available on Facebook (for example, your first and last
        names, email address, profile picture, your friend lists and birthdays). Your Profile is available to other
        users of the Service who are connected to you on Vanzay. In addition, unless you opt-out (which you may do at any
        time in the Vanzay application), your Profile is discoverable by other Vanzay users, including by way of example in
        listings of contacts that will include your proximity to other users. You may also “block out” any Vanzay user in
        your contact list from discovering your Profile at any time. In addition, Vanzay may pre-populate your Profile
        with certain information such as your name and Facebook profile picture if you or your friends have logged onto
        the Service using Facebook.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fn">Data Access and Removal</h2>

      <p>
        You can always control what information you choose to share with us on the Service. To do so, you can change
        your settings in the Service or in your mobile device. Alternatively, you can remove the Service from your
        mobile device entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can remove your data anytime you want. If you ask us to delete your account, we will use commercially
        reasonable efforts to remove your data from our servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any personally identifiable information that (i) you share in text messages, photos, videos or otherwise in or
        through the Vanzay application with other users, or (ii) submit on a blog, bulletin board or chat room on our
        website or elsewhere, can be viewed and used by others, including to send you unsolicited messages or to commit
        identity theft. Vanzay is not responsible for any use or misuse of your information that might result from your
        disclosure of information.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fn">Service Providers</h2>

      <p>
        In certain instances, Hyperconnect, Inc. and Vanzay may have contracts with third parties to provide products
        and/or services in connection with the Service. In those cases, Vanzay may share your personal information with
        Vanzay’s third-party service providers, but only in connection with providing the services to you. For example,
        Vanzay shares your phone number or email with third party SMS and email providers to deliver the authentication
        SMS or email to you when you register with Vanzay. We contractually require that these third parties use your
        information solely to deliver SMS or email to you and to use appropriate security measures to protect your
        information. In addition, certain Vanzay servers are owned and hosted by third party service providers. This
        Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third party service providers.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fn">Outbound Links</h2>

      <p>
        If you accessed a website, product or service provided by a third party, including through the Service or Vanzay
        website, such third party may also collect information about you. Please see the privacy policies of each such
        third party for more information about how they use the information they collect. This Privacy Policy does not
        apply to any exchange of information between you and any third party.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fn">Opt-Out – Promotional Communications</h2>

      <p>
        Vanzay allows you to choose not to receive promotional email messages from Vanzay and its service providers. You may
        opt-out by following instructions in the message sent by Vanzay or its service providers on how to unsubscribe
        from that particular mailing. You may also opt-out by contacting us at help@Vanzaylive.com.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fn">Security</h2>

      <p>
        Protecting user privacy and personal information is a top priority for Hyperconnect, Inc. and Vanzay. We make
        substantial efforts to ensure the privacy of all personally identifiable information you provide to us. Access
        to all personally identifiable information is restricted to those Hyperconnect, Inc. and Vanzay employees,
        contractors, agents and third-party service providers who need to know that information in order to provide,
        operate, develop, maintain, support or improve the Service. Hyperconnect, Inc. and Vanzay uses password
        protection, access logs, and system monitoring to safeguard the confidentiality and security of all member
        information.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition, due to the inherent nature of the Internet and related technology, we do not guarantee the
        protection of information under our control against loss, misuse or alteration.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fn">Data Transfer</h2>

      <p>
        Your information may be stored and processed in any country in which Hyperconnect, Inc. and Vanzay maintains
        facilities, including outside of the Repuplic of Korea. In this regard, or for purposes of sharing or disclosing
        data as described in this Privacy Policy, Hyperconnect, inc. and Vanzay reserves the right to transfer information
        outside of your country. By using the Service, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your
        country.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fn">Age</h2>

      <p>
        The Service is not directed to children under the age of thirteen (13) and we do not knowingly collect
        personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Service. If we become
        aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of
        thirteen as part of the Service, we will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in
        the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable
        information from children under the age of thirteen as part of the Service.
      </p>

      <h2 class="fn">Notification of Changes</h2>

      <p>
        We reserve the right at our discretion to make changes to this Privacy Policy. You may review updates to our
        Privacy Policy at any time via links on our website. You agree to accept electronic communications and/or
        postings of a revised Privacy Policy on the Hyperconnect, Inc. and Vanzay website, and you agree that such
        electronic communications or postings constitute notice to you of the Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to
        modify this policy from time to time, so please review it frequently.
      </p>

      <p>
